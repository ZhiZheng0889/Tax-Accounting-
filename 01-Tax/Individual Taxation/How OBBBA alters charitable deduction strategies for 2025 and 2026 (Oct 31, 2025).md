# How OBBBA alters charitable deduction strategies for 2025 and 2026 (Oct. 31, 2025)

**Type:** Study guide (planning-focused)
**Topic tags:** Tax planning; Charitable planning; Individual taxation
**Why this matters:** Several OBBBA changes begin in 2026 and generally reduce (or reshape) the federal tax value of charitable deductions for many itemizers, while creating a new small deduction for nonitemizers. Timing and “how you give” can matter.

## Executive summary (what changes, in one page)

### Effective 2026 (big picture)

- **New nonitemizer charitable deduction (cash only):** Up to **$1,000** per year (**$2,000 MFJ**) for cash gifts to qualified charities.
- **New itemizer floor:** Itemizers can deduct charitable gifts only to the extent they exceed **0.5% of contribution base** (generally AGI).
- **Top bracket “35% value cap” on itemized deductions:** For taxpayers in the **37%** bracket, the tax value of itemized deductions is capped as if the marginal rate were **35%**.
- **60% of AGI cash limit made permanent:** The **60% of AGI** limit for cash contributions (to public charities and certain foundations) no longer reverts back to 50% after 2025.

### Practical headline

- For **high-income itemizers**, the same charitable gift can produce a **smaller federal tax benefit starting in 2026**, so accelerating deductions into **2025** may be attractive.
- For **nonitemizers**, 2026 introduces a modest, easy-to-use benefit for small cash gifts (but it doesn’t make the standard deduction vs itemizing decision go away).

---

## Key definitions (use these consistently)

- **Nonitemizer:** Takes the standard deduction.
- **Itemizer:** Claims itemized deductions (Schedule A).
- **Contribution base:** Generally AGI (per the article).

---

## 1) New charitable deduction for nonitemizers (starts 2026)

### Rule (as described)

Beginning **Jan. 1, 2026**, taxpayers who do **not** itemize can deduct up to:

- **$1,000** (Single / non-joint)
- **$2,000** (Married filing jointly)

…for **cash contributions** made to qualified charities.

### Planning implications

- Encourage clients to **track small cash donations** (especially those who consistently take the standard deduction).
- It’s a “universal” deduction conceptually: the benefit is no longer limited to people who itemize.

### Practice prompts

- What counts as “cash” for the client (check, credit card, ACH) vs non-cash?
- Are gifts going to qualified organizations (vs individuals, GoFundMe-style gifts, etc.)?

---

## 2) New 0.5% floor for itemized charitable deductions (starts 2026)

### Rule (as described)

Starting **Jan. 1, 2026**, itemizers face an annual floor equal to **0.5%** of contribution base (generally AGI). Only charitable deductions **above** this floor are deductible.

### Why it matters

- This can eliminate the deduction impact for taxpayers whose annual giving is close to the floor.
- For high-AGI taxpayers, the floor amount rises with income.

### Planning levers

- **Front-load into 2025**: 2025 has **no floor** (per article).
- Consider giving in a year when **AGI is lower** so the floor is smaller.

Quick math examples:

- If AGI is $200,000, the floor is $1,000. Gifts above $1,000 create deductible value (for itemizers).
- If AGI is $1,000,000, the floor is $5,000. The first $5,000 of gifts has no itemized-deduction effect.

---

## 3) 60% of AGI cash contribution limit becomes permanent

### Rule (as described)

The **60% of AGI** limitation for cash contributions (to public charities and certain private foundations) remains in place beyond 2025.

### Practical impact

- This is not a new limitation for 2025 donors; it mostly affects expectations about a future reversion.
- Large cash gifts may still be limited by the 60% cap, even before considering the new 0.5% floor.

---

## 4) New ceiling on the value of itemized deductions for the 37% bracket (starts 2026)

### Rule (as described)

Beginning **Jan. 1, 2026**, taxpayers in the **top marginal bracket (37%)** only receive itemized deduction value at **35%**.

The disallowance is calculated as:

$$\frac{2}{37} \times \min(\text{total itemized deductions},\ \text{income taxed at 37%})$$

### What it means in plain English

If you’re in the top bracket, itemized deductions (including charitable) don’t reduce tax at the full 37% marginal rate; they’re effectively reduced to a 35% benefit for the portion subject to this rule.

### Example (rewritten from the article)

Assume AGI $1,000,000 and charitable gifts $100,000.

- In 2025: no 0.5% floor and (illustratively) a 37% marginal benefit → $100,000 × 37% = $37,000.
- In 2026: a $5,000 floor reduces deductible gifts to $95,000, and the value is capped at 35% → $95,000 × 35% = $33,250.

That’s a meaningful reduction for the same “check written,” which is why timing matters.

## 5) Timing strategies: 2025 vs 2026 (decision guide)

### If the client is a high-income itemizer (especially top bracket)

Consider accelerating deductible gifts into **2025** to avoid (in 2026+):

- the **0.5% floor**, and
- the **35% value cap** (if they remain in the 37% bracket).

### If the client is not in the top bracket / not always itemizing

- Consider whether **bunching in 2026** (two years of giving in one year) produces a better overall outcome than spreading gifts into late 2025.
- If the client takes the standard deduction most years, the **new nonitemizer deduction** in 2026 makes “smaller annual giving” more consistently tax-relevant.

---

## 6) Tools to implement planning

### A) Donor-advised funds (DAFs)

**Core idea:** Separate the timing of the **tax deduction** from the timing of **grants to operating charities**.

- Fund the DAF in **2025** (get the 2025 deduction).
- Recommend grants to charities over **2026+** based on client preference.

Common fit:

- One-time income spikes (bonus, liquidity event, business sale, inheritance).
- Appreciated assets (client may avoid capital gain while receiving an FMV-based deduction, subject to applicable limits).

### B) Charitable bunching

**Core idea:** Make multiple years of charitable contributions in one year to push itemized deductions high enough to beat the standard deduction.

- For donors impacted by the 2026 floor/value cap, bunching in **2025** can maximize deduction value.
- For moderate-income donors, bunching in **2026** may still make sense (depending on itemization dynamics).

### C) Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs)

**Core idea:** For taxpayers age **70½+**, donate directly from an IRA to keep the amount out of income.

- Can reduce AGI and help manage exposure to itemized-deduction limitations.
- Especially relevant for clients taking RMDs.

Article’s figures to remember:

- 2025 QCD limit: **$108,000 per person** (so potentially $108,000 each spouse).

Important sequencing note:

- If the goal is to reduce the RMD included in income, execute QCDs **before** taking distributions that satisfy the RMD.

## 7) Client-facing checklist (year-end 2025)

- Is the client likely to be an **itemizer** in 2025? In 2026?
- Is the client likely to be in the **37% bracket** in 2026?
- What’s the client’s expected **2026 AGI** (floor planning) and can AGI be managed?
- Would accelerating gifts into 2025 create cash-flow issues (or can a DAF smooth it)?
- For older clients: should gifts be made via **QCD** instead of checks?
- Are any gifts better made with **appreciated assets** rather than cash?

---

## Practice questions (quick)

1) A client expects AGI to drop materially in 2026. How does that affect the 0.5% floor planning decision?
2) What are the three “big levers” described to manage 2026 charitable deduction headwinds?
3) For a client over 70½ with RMDs and charitable intent, why might QCD be preferable to a cash gift?
4) How does a DAF help with 2025 vs 2026 timing?
5) For a nonitemizer who gives $50/month to a qualified charity, what changes starting in 2026?
