## What this covers (high level)

This guide summarizes and drills the key takeaways from a semiannual update on individual federal tax developments, organized roughly by Code section. Focus is on what changed (cases/rulings/guidance), what the rule is, what the IRS/courts emphasized, and what you should do differently in practice.

## Learning objectives

After working this guide, you should be able to:

- Explain the substantiation theme running through the NOL cases (Sec. 172).
- Apply the Sec. 183 “hobby loss” framework using the nine nonexclusive regulatory factors.
- Distinguish deductible medical expenses from nondeductible personal/family arrangement costs (Sec. 213).
- State when moving expenses remain deductible post-TCJA (Sec. 217(g)).
- Describe select retirement-plan and inherited IRA developments affecting individuals (Sec. 401).
- Explain how passive activity credit limits can disallow investment credits (Sec. 469).
- Recall how Sec. 1256 interacts with Sec. 165(c) and profit motive limitations.
- Identify recurring issues in self-employment tax characterization (Secs. 1401–1402).
- Outline when innocent spouse relief is allowed vs denied and why (Sec. 6015).

## Map of topics in this guide

## Sec. 172 — Net operating loss (NOL) deduction: substantiation matters

### Core rule to remember

An NOL carryover/carryforward is not “self-proving.” The taxpayer bears the burden to establish:

- The fact of the loss in the originating year(s)
- The amount of the loss
- That the loss was properly carried to the year at issue (and not already absorbed)

### Developments highlighted

- **Kinney (9th Cir.)**: A handwritten table + testimony, without underlying return support, was not enough to substantiate an NOL carryover.
- **Mosley (Tax Ct.)**: NOL carryforward disallowed where the taxpayer could not document the originating loss calculation and failed to make a timely election affecting carryback/carryforward treatment.

### Practice takeaways

- Treat NOLs like a “paper trail” project: keep the originating-year returns, workpapers, and any amendments.
- Reconstructing an NOL years later is hard; courts tend to expect contemporaneous records.
- If an election is required (e.g., to waive a carryback period when applicable), confirm it was made correctly and on time.

### Quick self-check questions

- What documents would you need to prove the originating-year loss amount?
- How would you show the NOL was not previously used up?
- If the IRS challenges the carryover, what is your best evidence: schedules, transcripts, copies of returns, or something else?

### Mini-checklist (client file)

- Copy of original return(s) for NOL year(s)
- Workpapers computing NOL (including modifications/limitations)
- Carryforward schedule year-by-year showing absorption
- IRS account transcripts (helpful corroboration)
- Proof of any elections (and date/time filed)

## Sec. 183 — Activities not engaged in for profit (the “hobby loss” rules)

### Core rule to remember

If an activity is not engaged in for profit, deductions are limited to the activity’s gross income (losses generally cannot offset other income). Determination is facts-and-circumstances.

### The nine-factor framework (Regs. Sec. 1.183-2(b))

No single factor controls; weigh them collectively:

1. Manner of carrying on the activity (businesslike? books? changes to improve profitability?)
2. Expertise of the taxpayer/advisers
3. Time and effort devoted
4. Expectation that assets may appreciate
5. Success in other similar activities
6. History of income or losses
7. Amount of occasional profits (if any)
8. Financial status of the taxpayer (dependence on income vs ability to fund losses)
9. Elements of personal pleasure or recreation

### Developments highlighted

- **Bucci (2d Cir., affirming Tax Ct.)**: Horse racing + hay farming treated as not-for-profit activities. Key themes: chronic losses, limited businesslike conduct (especially for farming), and significant personal enjoyment; the taxpayer had substantial other wealth.
- **Himmel (Tax Ct.)**: Long-running Arabian horse activity lacked a bona fide profit objective. The court emphasized weak planning/adjustments, commingling or poor record discipline, decades of losses, limited sales activity, and substantial personal enjoyment/social benefits.

### Practice takeaways (how to “audit-proof” a profit motive)

- Put a real plan in writing: pricing, marketing, cost controls, and *what you will change* if losses persist.
- Maintain clean books and separate bank/credit accounts.
- Document expertise: training, industry research, and consultations.
- Track time spent and tasks performed.
- If the pitch includes appreciation (e.g., animals, land, collectibles), keep defensible valuation support.

### Spot-the-factor prompts

- What would you point to as “operated in a businesslike manner” evidence?
- If losses have run for 5+ years, what specific operational changes were made?
- If the taxpayer has high outside income, what counters the “tax shelter” narrative?

## Sec. 213 — Medical expenses: IVF allowed; gestational surrogacy denied (in ruling)

### Core rule to remember

Medical expenses are deductible only if they are for “medical care” of the taxpayer, spouse, or a dependent (and subject to the $7.5\%$ of AGI floor).

### Development highlighted

- **Letter Ruling 202518023 (Feb. 4, 2025)**: The IRS allowed medical expense deductions for IVF-related items in the fact pattern (e.g., screenings, fertility medications and treatment, egg and sperm retrieval). The IRS denied a deduction for expenses related to **gestational surrogacy** because those costs were not for the medical care of the taxpayers or a dependent under Sec. 213(a).

### Practice takeaways

- Separate invoices and categorize costs early: IVF medical procedures/medications vs third-party arrangement costs.
- Confirm “whose medical care” is being paid for. If the care is provided to a nondependent third party, the Sec. 213 path may be blocked.
- Remember the AGI floor: even “qualified” expenses may not yield a deduction depending on AGI.

### Client interview prompts

- Who received the procedures and whose name is on the bills?
- Are any costs for legal contracts, agency fees, or compensation unrelated to medical procedures?
- Do you expect to clear the $7.5\%$ AGI threshold this year, or should you consider bunching eligible expenses?

## Sec. 217 — Moving expenses: the post-TCJA military-only rule

### Core rule to remember

For most taxpayers, the moving expense deduction is suspended (TCJA-era change). A narrow exception remains for a **member of the Armed Forces on active duty** who moves pursuant to a military order and incident to a permanent change of station (Sec. 217(g)).

### Development highlighted

- **Kent (Tax Ct.)**: Civilian Air Force contractor received official travel orders and was directed to move, but neither spouse was military. The court held the taxpayers could not claim the moving expense deduction because Sec. 217(g) applies only to active-duty Armed Forces members.

### Practice takeaways

- “Orders” alone are not enough; confirm the taxpayer is active duty in the Armed Forces (not civilian, not contractor, not general federal employee).
- Document status: DD-214 equivalents, LES, active-duty documentation, and PCS orders.
- For nonmilitary moves, focus on employer reimbursement treatment and payroll reporting rather than a Sec. 217 deduction.

## Sec. 401 — Retirement plans / IRAs: Roth catch-up proposals and inherited IRA transfers

### A. Proposed regs: Roth catch-up contribution requirement (high earners)

#### What to remember

Proposed rules under Sec. 414(v)(7)(A) address the “Roth catch-up requirement” for applicable employer plans: when an eligible participant’s wages exceed a specified threshold (the article notes $145,000$), catch-up contributions must be treated as **designated Roth** contributions.

#### Practical implications (plan + participant)

- Plans may implement a **deemed** Roth designation for catch-up contributions for impacted participants.
- Participants must be given an option to stop making the additional deferrals (instead of being forced into a deemed Roth election).
- Because Roth deferrals are includible in income, impacted participants should expect higher current-year taxable wages/withholding effects for catch-up amounts.

#### Review prompt

- If a participant is above the wage threshold and wants pre-tax catch-up, what are their realistic alternatives (e.g., adjust deferral strategy, use other savings vehicles) given the Roth catch-up framework?

### B. Inherited IRA transfers: trust beneficiary to individual inherited IRAs

#### Development highlighted

- **Letter Ruling 202506004 (Nov. 7, 2024)**: A trust that was the designated beneficiary of a decedent’s retirement account could transfer funds via trustee-to-trustee transfers into inherited IRAs for the individual beneficiaries, provided the inherited IRAs were properly titled in the name of the deceased owner for the benefit of each beneficiary. The transfer itself did not trigger taxable income to the trust/beneficiary, though beneficiaries must include income in respect of a decedent (IRD) amounts in gross income when applicable.

#### Practice takeaways

- Titling is everything: inherited IRA setup must preserve “decedent for benefit of beneficiary” naming.
- Trustee-to-trustee transfer mechanics reduce distribution/rollover errors.
- Always coordinate trust terms + beneficiary categories + distribution timing rules before moving assets.

## Sec. 469 — Passive activity credit limits: why investment credits can be disallowed

### Core rule to remember

Passive activity credits generally can only offset **tax attributable to passive activities**. If the taxpayer has no passive income/tax liability allocable to passive activities, the passive activity credit may be disallowed (and potentially carried forward).

### Development highlighted

- **Strieby (Tax Ct.)**: Taxpayers claimed investment tax credits tied to a solar LLC investment. The court explained that the Sec. 48 “investment tax credit” is a component within the Sec. 38 general business credit, which is treated as a passive activity credit under Sec. 469(d)(2). Because the taxpayers did not materially participate and had no passive income, the credits were limited/disallowed under Sec. 469.

### Practice takeaways

- When clients buy into credit-driven deals, ask *first*: will the credit be passive for them? Do they have passive income/tax to absorb it?
- “Signing documents and writing checks” is typically not material participation.
- Expect IRS scrutiny when documentation is inconsistent (missing partnership filings, missing forms like Form 3468/3800, mismatched K-1 numbers).

### Quick diagnostic questions

- Is the activity a trade/business the taxpayer materially participates in?
- If not, does the taxpayer have other passive income this year to absorb credits?
- Are all required credit forms and partnership reporting present and internally consistent?

## Sec. 1256 — Section 1256 contracts: mark-to-market meets the individual loss limits

### Core rule to remember

Sec. 1256 generally marks certain contracts to market at year end and characterizes gain/loss under its special rules. But individuals still face the baseline limitation that personal losses are not deductible unless they fit within Sec. 165(c) (profit-motivated transaction, trade/business, etc.).

### Development highlighted

- **Wright (Tax Ct., after remand)**: The dispute involved an OTC foreign currency option entered into by an LLC owned by the taxpayers and later assigned, generating a claimed loss. After the Sixth Circuit held the option could qualify as a foreign currency contract under Sec. 1256, the Tax Court on remand still denied the deduction because the transaction was not entered into with a primary profit motive under Sec. 165(c).

### Practice takeaways

- Even if you win a “technical classification” issue (e.g., Sec. 1256 treatment), you can still lose on the threshold question: was this a deductible-loss transaction for an individual?
- When a loss position looks “manufactured” or non-economic, expect profit motive scrutiny and document the business/investment rationale.
- Build the file early: contemporaneous trading strategy notes, risk management docs, and evidence of expected economic return.

### Exam-style prompts

- If a taxpayer has a transaction that qualifies under Sec. 1256, what additional hurdle might still deny the loss?
- What facts would you look for to support profit motive (vs personal/other motives) in a derivatives transaction?

## Secs. 1401–1402 — Self-employment tax: characterization and the “limited partner” exception

### A. Sec. 1401 rate / recharacterization: prior IRS refund is not a concession

#### Development highlighted

- **Clark (Tax Ct.)**: Taxpayer treated recurring business income as “other income” not subject to SE tax. The IRS reversed a premature SE tax assessment during pending litigation and refunded, but the Tax Court still held the taxpayer liable for SE tax on the income.

#### Practice takeaways

- A procedural refund (fixing an account during litigation) is not a substantive concession about taxability.
- If facts show the taxpayer is carrying on a trade/business, SE tax exposure remains even if the return labels it otherwise.
- For mixed activities (writing, online sales, gig work), maintain clear books and document whether the activity is ongoing, profit-oriented, and regular.

### B. Sec. 1402 definitions: who is really a “limited partner” for SE tax purposes?

#### Core rule to remember

Sec. 1402(a)(13) provides an exception for a limited partner’s distributive share (with important nuances). The Tax Court continues to apply a functional analysis: labels in the partnership agreement are not controlling.

#### Development highlighted

- **Denham Capital Management (Tax Ct.)**: Partners in a private equity firm were “limited in name only.” Despite the limited partnership form, the individuals devoted substantially all time to the business, were integral to generating fees, and engaged in management decisions. Their distributive shares were included in net earnings from self-employment.

#### Practice takeaways

- Expect a role-based inquiry: time commitment, decision authority, client/service work, and whether distributions are really compensation for services.
- If only one partner contributes capital but multiple partners receive large “distributions,” be prepared to explain the economic deal and service component.
- Review how guaranteed payments, salary-like policies, and operational responsibilities align with the SE tax position.

### Quick diagnostic questions

- Is the taxpayer providing services to the partnership’s customers/portfolio, or primarily investing capital?
- Does the partnership agreement require substantial time and attention?
- Are “distributions” economically tied to labor (fees/services) rather than capital at risk?
