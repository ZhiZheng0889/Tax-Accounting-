**Type:** Study guide (summary + practice)
**Topic:** Individual Income Taxation (recent federal developments)
**Coverage window:** Six months ending April 2025 (per article)
**Primary use:** Quick recall + exam/interview prompts + client-facing planning notes

## What this covers (high level)

This guide summarizes and drills the key takeaways from a semiannual update on individual federal tax developments, organized roughly by Code section. Focus is on what changed (cases/rulings/guidance), what the rule is, what the IRS/courts emphasized, and what you should do differently in practice.

## Learning objectives

After working this guide, you should be able to:

- Explain the substantiation theme running through the NOL cases (Sec. 172).
- Apply the Sec. 183 “hobby loss” framework using the nine nonexclusive regulatory factors.
- Distinguish deductible medical expenses from nondeductible personal/family arrangement costs (Sec. 213).
- State when moving expenses remain deductible post-TCJA (Sec. 217(g)).
- Describe select retirement-plan and inherited IRA developments affecting individuals (Sec. 401).
- Explain how passive activity credit limits can disallow investment credits (Sec. 469).
- Recall how Sec. 1256 interacts with Sec. 165(c) and profit motive limitations.
- Identify recurring issues in self-employment tax characterization (Secs. 1401–1402).
- Outline when innocent spouse relief is allowed vs denied and why (Sec. 6015).

## Map of topics in this guide

## Sec. 172 — Net operating loss (NOL) deduction: substantiation matters

### Core rule to remember

An NOL carryover/carryforward is not “self-proving.” The taxpayer bears the burden to establish:

- The fact of the loss in the originating year(s)
- The amount of the loss
- That the loss was properly carried to the year at issue (and not already absorbed)

### Developments highlighted

- **Kinney (9th Cir.)**: A handwritten table + testimony, without underlying return support, was not enough to substantiate an NOL carryover.
- **Mosley (Tax Ct.)**: NOL carryforward disallowed where the taxpayer could not document the originating loss calculation and failed to make a timely election affecting carryback/carryforward treatment.

### Practice takeaways

- Treat NOLs like a “paper trail” project: keep the originating-year returns, workpapers, and any amendments.
- Reconstructing an NOL years later is hard; courts tend to expect contemporaneous records.
- If an election is required (e.g., to waive a carryback period when applicable), confirm it was made correctly and on time.

### Quick self-check questions

- What documents would you need to prove the originating-year loss amount?
- How would you show the NOL was not previously used up?
- If the IRS challenges the carryover, what is your best evidence: schedules, transcripts, copies of returns, or something else?

### Mini-checklist (client file)

- Copy of original return(s) for NOL year(s)
- Workpapers computing NOL (including modifications/limitations)
- Carryforward schedule year-by-year showing absorption
- IRS account transcripts (helpful corroboration)
- Proof of any elections (and date/time filed)
