## Description

Reviews the professional and ethical standards that govern tax practice, including due
diligence requirements, documentation expectations, reliance on client information, and

- When must you disclose uncertain tax positions or advise a client about potential penalties?
- How should you document advice, client communications, and positions taken to protect both you and the client?
- How do you balance client advocacy with your ethical and legal responsibilities as a tax professional?
- Think of a grey-area scenario. How would these standards guide your response?
