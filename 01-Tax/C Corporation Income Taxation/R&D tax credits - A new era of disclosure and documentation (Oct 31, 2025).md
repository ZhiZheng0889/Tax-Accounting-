# R&D tax credits: A new era of disclosure and documentation (Oct. 31, 2025)

**Type:** Study guide (compliance + audit defense)
**Topic tags:** Sec. 41 credit; Refund claims; Documentation; Form 6765; IRS procedure

> This is a study aid written in original language based on the provided article text. Use primary authority for advice.

## Why this matters (one paragraph)

The Sec. 41 R&D credit remains a major incentive, but the IRS has moved toward **front-end disclosure** and **project-level substantiation**. Court decisions and IRS announcements show that taxpayers can lose (or be delayed) on **procedure and specificity**, even before the IRS evaluates whether the research qualifies on the merits.

---

## Key theme: “Defensible claim” now means upfront clarity

The article’s core message is that the R&D credit environment has shifted toward:

- More structured disclosure at filing (especially for refund claims).
- Documentation that is organized by **business component / project**.
- Cost support that ties wages/supplies/contract research to those projects.

A useful simplification for organizing narratives and workpapers is:

1) **What did you make?**
2) **Why is it qualified?**
3) **How much did it cost?**

## Case law shaping procedural expectations

### 1) Harper (9th Cir. 2021): Waiver of procedural objection (but don’t rely on it)

**What happened:** The taxpayer submitted refund claims with massive documentation, but the IRS later tried to dismiss on the ground that the original claim lacked sufficient detail under the refund-claim specificity standard.

**Holding highlighted by the article:** The Ninth Circuit held the IRS **waived** its procedural objection by accepting the claim and auditing it for years.

**Why it matters:**

- Harper “won,” but the warning is clear: taxpayers should not expect a long audit to cure a weak filing.
- The dispute was about **form/procedure**, not whether the underlying research qualified.

### 2) Premier Tech (D. Utah 2022): Project-level specificity pressure

**What happened:** A refund claim on an amended return included Form 6765 with wage/supply costs. The government argued it still lacked enough detail because it did not describe research and tie costs to projects/components.

**Outcome highlighted:** The court found the filing provided enough information to be a valid administrative claim.

**Why it matters:**

- Even “properly filled out” forms can become targets for procedural challenges.
- The trend pushed the IRS to formalize what it wants at the time of filing.

## IRS guidance: IR-2021-203 and the June 2024 update

### The IRS’s “required information” framework for refund claims

The article describes how the IRS set prerequisites for a valid research credit refund claim.

**Originally required elements (IRS announcement):**

- Identify all business components covered by the claim.
- Describe research activities for each component.
- Names of individuals who performed each activity.
- Information each individual sought to discover.
- Total qualified wage, supply, and contract research expenses.

### June 2024 update (administrative relief)

The IRS waived (at filing time) two items:

- Names of individuals who performed each research activity.
- The information each individual sought to discover.

But taxpayers still must provide:

- Business components.
- Description of research activities per component.
- Total qualified wage/supply/contract research expenses (which may be reported on Form 6765).

**Practical takeaway:** The waived items may still be requested during exam, so the documentation should still exist.

## The Sec. 41(d) four-part test (and how to document it)

### Four-part test (as summarized)

1) **Sec. 174 test:** Activities involve research/experimental expenditures aimed at eliminating uncertainty in developing or improving a product/process in the business.
2) **Technological in nature:** Based on hard sciences (engineering, CS, physical/biological science, etc.).
3) **Business component:** Develops or improves a product/process/software/technique/formula/invention used in the business or held for sale/license/lease.
4) **Process of experimentation:** Substantially all activities are a systematic process evaluating alternatives to eliminate uncertainty.

### “IRS distilled lens” (organize your file this way)

- **What did you make?** (Business component identification and intended use: sale/license/internal)
- **Why is it qualified?** (Uncertainty + experimentation narrative)
- **How much did it cost?** (Project-level cost build: wages/supplies/contract research)

---

## Where scrutiny is highest (industry patterns)

The article flags heightened scrutiny in:

- **Manufacturing** (tooling, prototyping, custom fabrication)
- **Architecture & engineering (A&E)** (mixed standard design + innovation)
- **Software development** (distinguishing qualifying development from routine maintenance)

**Practical point:** The more cross-functional/agile the workflow, the more important contemporaneous documentation becomes to separate qualified from nonqualified work.

---

## Project-level cost accounting: the operational requirement

To compute and defend the credit, the article emphasizes project-level cost support. That typically requires coordination across:

- Engineering / product / software teams (project narratives and technical uncertainties)
- Finance / accounting (time tracking, job costing, allocations)
- Tax (tying the narrative to the Sec. 41 framework and preparing Form 6765)

**Risk patterns without project costing:**

- Underclaiming by missing eligible costs.
- Overclaiming by including nonqualified work.
- Failing the substantiation expectations embedded in the redesigned Form 6765.

## Practical “build a defensible claim” checklist

### Filing package (refund claim mindset)

- Business component list (project inventory) for the claim year.
- Short narrative per component: uncertainty + experimentation + technical field.
- Cost summary by component: qualified wages, supplies, contract research.
- Crosswalk from project costing → Form 6765 totals.

### Workpaper file (audit defense)

- Contemporaneous artifacts (design docs, test plans, prototypes, tickets, change logs).
- Time tracking methodology and controls (who enters time, review cadence, project codes).
- Exclusion memo for nonqualified activities (routine maintenance, cosmetic changes, standard design).
- Role-based support if individuals are not provided at filing time (still keep internally).

## Practice questions (quick)

1) In one sentence, what did Harper teach about procedural objections and IRS waiver?
2) Why does Premier Tech matter even though the taxpayer prevailed?
3) What are the three core elements the IRS still expects at filing time after the June 2024 update?
4) Convert the four-part test into “what/why/how much” prompts for a software project.
5) What is the single biggest documentation weakness for a company without project-level time tracking?
