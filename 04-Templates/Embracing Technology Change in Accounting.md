## Description

A big-picture look at how automation, AI, cloud platforms, and specialized apps reshape

stay relevant. Think about how your own workflows could change over the next 3-5 years
and what you can do now to prepare.

## Focus questions

- Which of your current tasks are most likely to be automated, and how could you move up the value chain?
- How can firms evaluate which tools to adopt (cost, integration, security, staff skill level)?
- What risks (data, security, dependence on vendors) and opportunities (advisory services, efficiency) come with rapid technology change?
- If you had to pick one process in your work to re-design with technology, what would it be and why?
