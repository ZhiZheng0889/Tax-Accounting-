Tax & Accounting Notes

This workspace is organized for capturing and organizing your tax and accounting knowledge, especially Word documents from note‑taking.

Structure
- 01-Tax: Personal/business tax notes, planning, cases, summaries of IRS/state guidance.
- 02-Accounting: Bookkeeping, financial statements, GAAP/IFRS topics, workflows.
- 03-References: Authoritative references (IRS pubs, state regs), links, PDFs.
- 04-Templates: Note templates, checklists, workpaper formats for reuse.

Suggested conventions
- File names: YYYY-MM-DD Topic – Detail.docx (e.g., 2025-11-12 Depreciation – MACRS basis.docx)
- Keep “index” docs in each folder to summarize what’s inside (e.g., Index.docx).
- Drop working drafts in the right folder first; refine structure as content grows.

Notes
- You can rename or add subfolders anytime (e.g., 01-Tax/Personal, 01-Tax/Business).
- Consider storing key PDFs in 03-References and linking to them from your notes.
