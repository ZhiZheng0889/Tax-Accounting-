## Description / context

Covers the essentials of explaining complex ideas clearly: structuring documents,
choosing precise language, using examples and visuals, and editing for clarity and
readability. This is directly useful for memos, emails to clients, documentation, and
training materials.

## Focus questions

- What makes technical content clear rather than confusing (structure, word choice, assumptions about the reader)?
- How should you structure a technical explanation so that a busy reader can follow it quickly?
- Which editing steps such as shortening sentences, replacing jargon, or adding headings improve readability the most?
- How can you use concrete examples or simple diagrams to make abstract concepts understandable?
- Pick one recent email or memo you wrote. How could you rewrite it using these principles?
