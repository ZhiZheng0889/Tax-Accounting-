**Category:** Accounting and Analysis
**PDF:** PDF\handoutsaccountingformanagers091720251757409796755.pdf

## Description

Introduces non-accountant managers to the language of accounting: how transactions
become numbers, how those numbers flow into the income statement, balance sheet, and
cash flow statement, and how to use this information to make better operational
decisions.

## Focus questions

- What do managers need to understand about the income statement to interpret performance (revenue quality, margins, trends)?
- How do accruals, deferrals, and estimates such as bad debts or depreciation affect reported results and decision-making?
- Which simple ratios (margin, turnover, leverage) are most useful for non-financial managers, and how should they interpret them?
- How can managers link key performance indicators back to the underlying accounting data?
- Think of a recent decision you or a manager made. How could better use of financial statements have improved that decision?
