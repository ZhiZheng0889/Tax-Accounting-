performance, risk, and cash generation over time.

## Focus questions

- What can you learn from the cash flow statement that the income statement does not show, such as the quality of earnings or cash sufficiency?
- Which trends in financial statements signal increasing risk, for example leverage, declining margins, or deteriorating liquidity?
- How would you approach analyzing a new company you have never seen before using these statements?
- Choose one ratio you find confusing and write out, in words, what it tells you about a business.
